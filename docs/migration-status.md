# Migration status

Live tracker for the 6-milestone Rust port. Update after each milestone closes. The full migration plan lives in `~/src/graphrefly-ts/archive/docs/SESSION-rust-port-architecture.md`.

## Current state (2026-05-04)

**Phase 13.7 v0 bench complete (6 passes); all three axes confirmed in Rust's favor.**

- **Pass 2 — Pure dispatcher:** Rust 2.3×–3.4× faster than TS.
- **Pass 3 — Through napi-rs FFI:** Rust 1.24×–2.03× faster end-to-end; FFI overhead ~51 ns/call.
- **Pass 4 — Cross-Worker shared state:** uniquely possible in Rust; TS literally cannot do it without `SharedArrayBuffer` gymnastics. 4-Worker contention is ~2× slower than single-Worker but the capability is the win.
- **Pass 5 — Tuning attempts:** SmallVec + ChildEdge dep_idx caching both regressed. Pass 2 (ahash) is a local optimum at the current architectural shape; further wins need structural changes (per-subgraph locks, lock-free reads, PGO).
- **Pass 6 — Memory:** 1000-node chain × 1M emits, TOTAL process memory (RSS — Rust+JS combined vs pure JS): TS peaks at 214.59 MiB; Rust+JS at 976 KiB (**TS 225× more at peak**, **97× more post-GC**). JS-heap-only ratio is 3,157× (V8 pressure isolated). Rust eliminates GC pressure on dispatcher hot path.

See [`rust-bench-v0-results.md`](https://github.com/graphrefly/graphrefly-ts/blob/main/docs/research/rust-bench-v0-results.md) for the full numbers.

DS-14 still open; full M1 commit (PAUSE/RESUME, INVALIDATE, COMPLETE/ERROR/TEARDOWN, full feature parity) gated on DS-14 lock per Phase 13.7 re-decision gate.

| Milestone | Crate | Status | Notes |

## Phase 13.7 bench study — re-decision gate

Per [implementation-plan.md Phase 13.7](https://github.com/graphrefly/graphrefly-ts/blob/main/docs/implementation-plan.md#phase-137):

After M1 dispatcher + bench data lands, **PAUSE** before extending to M2/M3/M4/M5. DS-14 must lock before any further Rust work — confirmed user direction 2026-05-03.

## Pre-M1 dependencies (in graphrefly-ts)

- [x] **Phase 13.6.A — rules/invariants audit + locking** ✅ locked 2026-05-03 ([implementation-plan-13.6-canonical-spec.md](https://github.com/graphrefly/graphrefly-ts/blob/main/docs/implementation-plan-13.6-canonical-spec.md), 24 invariant locks).
- [x] **`setDeps()` design + TLA+ verification** ✅ verified 2026-05-03 ([wave_protocol_rewire.tla](https://github.com/graphrefly/graphrefly-ts/blob/main/docs/research/wave_protocol_rewire.tla), 35,950 distinct states clean; [rewire-design-notes.md](https://github.com/graphrefly/graphrefly-ts/blob/main/docs/research/rewire-design-notes.md)).
- [ ] **Phase 14 design lock — DS-14.** Gates M2/M4/M5 *and* full M1 commit (the Phase 13.7 bench study runs ahead of this gate).

## M1 entry checklist

- [x] Tuning Pass 5: SmallVec + ChildEdge dep_idx caching both regressed; Pass 2 (ahash) is a local optimum. Further wins need per-subgraph locks / lock-free reads / PGO ✅ 2026-05-04.
- [ ] Stand up TLC-runs-in-CI step using existing `wave_protocol_*_MC.tla` + the new `wave_protocol_rewire_MC.tla` against the handle interpretation.

## Reference impl

The TS prototype at `~/src/graphrefly-ts/src/__experiments__/handle-core/` is the reference implementation for the handle protocol. Port it module-for-module:

| TS file | Rust target |
|---------|-------------|
| `core.ts` (~370 lines, all Core dispatch) | `crates/graphrefly-core/src/{message,handle,boundary,node,batch}.rs` |
| `bindings.ts` (~370 lines, value registry + FFI counters + dynamic builder) | `crates/graphrefly-bindings-js/src/{value_registry,counters,*}.rs` |
| `core.test.ts` (13 tests) | `crates/graphrefly-core/tests/` (integration tests) |
| `extensions.test.ts` (9 tests, FFI counters + dynamic + refcount) | same |

The Rust impl should pass the same 22 invariant tests plus additional Rust-specific tests (Send/Sync discipline, panic safety, leak detection under loom).

## Open architectural questions (not blocking M1, but worth re-validating during port)

From `SESSION-rust-port-architecture.md` Open Questions section:

1. **Cross-language handle-space composition.** TS-frontend mounting Python-frontend subgraph — disjoint registries; explicit serialize bridge or process boundary? Out of scope until post-M6.
2. **Async fn boundary modeling in TLA+.** Current spec is sync-only; pyo3 async path needs additional MC.
3. **Refcount soundness companion module.** Handle leak detection in production; smoke-tested in TS prototype, needs production-grade Rust impl.
4. **Custom-equals oracle correctness beyond identity-extension** (symmetry/transitivity).
5. **Phase 14 missing `### Phase 14 — …` header** in `~/src/graphrefly-ts/docs/implementation-plan.md` (line ~1207). Trivial fix when next touching that file.

## Closing a milestone

When a milestone closes:

1. Update this file's status table.
2. Add a `## Mn — closed YYYY-MM-DD` section below documenting what landed, what was deferred, and how the milestone's deliverables map back to the migration plan.
3. Cross-reference any spec amendments (issues filed against `graphrefly/graphrefly`) and any TS-side changes (PRs against `graphrefly-ts`).
4. Tag a release: `git tag -a vM<n>.0.0 -m "Mn complete"` and bump `[workspace.package].version` in the workspace `Cargo.toml`.

## Post-1.0 backlog

Per the deferral guardrails in `~/src/graphrefly-ts/docs/implementation-plan.md` Phase 14:

- CRDT-backed `reactiveMap` / `reactiveLog` variants (`yrs`, `automerge`, `loro`, `diamond-types`)
- `peerGraph(transport)` multi-replica sync via libp2p
- Cross-replica changeset merging with CRDT semantics
- Tighter cross-tier WAL atomicity beyond best-effort

These are post-1.0 by deliberate design — they need the substrate that M5 establishes, and the libraries Rust offers (vs. what TS would have to re-implement). Don't land them until M1–M6 close.
